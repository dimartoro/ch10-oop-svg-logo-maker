# Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker

## Description
The Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker command-line application generates a simple logo for a user projects. As an example of the functionality of the application I walk you through the steps required to generate a SVG logo from a list of three shapes' options: a circle, a square and a tringle. The application will ask you to select the desired shape, enter up to three characters, the text color and the shape color. Colors can be the name of the color or a hexadecimal number. When the questions are captured the application will generate the logo from your selections and it will be saved as an SVG file that you will be able to reveal in File Explorer. The Object Oriented Programing SVG Logo Maker includes a test for each of the shapes where the passing result will ensure the code works as expected.

## Installation
Clone to your local computer the Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker command-line application located in my remote repository at https://github.com/dimartoro/ch10-oop-svg-logo-maker.git Open your Windows CMD in your local computer and write CD until your CMD displays the index.js file inside the directory ch10-oop-svg-logo-maker. The index.js is the executable file of the program. In CMD write node index.js and start answering the questions that with your answers will generate the SVG logo for your project. Continue looking the video at the bottom that will walk you through the step by step Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker command-line functionality.

## Usage
You can quickly and easily generate a simple SVG logo for your project by using my Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker application.

## Tests
The generation of a new SVG logo file will successfully pass the testing. On the other hand each of the shapes "passing" test will validate successfully the instantiation of the class, the assignation of properties, and that the render() method returns the expected values.
